## Binary Format

File extension: `mrsim, mrsimulation`

> TODO: Document once the MRSimulation 2.0 binary codec is complete.

## Plain-Text Format

File extension: `mrsim-txt, mrsimulation-txt`

The plain-text format is designed to be easy to parse from a Python script. It is slower and consumes more memory than the binary format. You may also face performance issues, as Python is not a fast language[^1]. Nonetheless, this greatly reduces the barrier to usability.

The plain-text format is based on YAML, and arranges characters in a way that maximizes compression ratio during ZIP compression. After serializing the MD trajectory to a text file, run an external archiver application to transform it into a `.zip`. This reduces file size when sharing over the internet or storing on disk. More efficient techniques can serialize chunks of the text one-by-one using the Python `zlib` library. If Python had multithreading, you could serialize all the chunks in parallel.

In the binary format, each atom's element ID and flags are stored per-frame. 99% of the time, these will never change, and the compressor ignores them. The plain-text format doesn't allow flags to change per frame. Technically they can change per frame cluster, although that is ill-advised.

## Decoding Script

Implementations:
- Swift: [MRSimulationDecoder.swift](./Scripts/MRSimulationDecoder.swift)
- Python: [MRSimulationDecoder.py](./Scripts/MRSimulationDecoder.py)
- Rust: [simulation-import](../Sources/SimulationImport)

To test the decoder, open a terminal window. Set the path of the file to decode:

```bash
export FILE="<mrsim-to-decode>.mrsim-txt"
```

Here is a Swift script for decoding the plain-text MRSimulation format. Add the Swift toolchain to the PATH, then type the following.

```bash
# (Unix)
swiftc -D RELEASE -Ounchecked MRSimulationDecoder.swift && ./MRSimulationDecoder "$FILE" && rm ./MRSimulationDecoder

# (Windows)
swiftc -D RELEASE -Ounchecked MRSimulationDecoder.swift
MRSimulationDecoder.exe "$FILE.mrsim-txt"
```

Next, the Swift script is translated to Python. This code can be copied into your existing Python codebase, and used to supply atoms to an external renderer. If the latencies for Python not acceptable, refer to the footnote[^1].

```bash
python3 MRSimulationDecoder.py $FILE
```

## Future Directions

Metadata sub-specifications:
- Format for denoting which atoms belong to a specific rigid body. Although this may be detectable through geometry traversal, making it explicit would be cheaper and more reliable.
  - Every frame, the linear and angular velocities of each rigid body would be stored in metadata. In addition, center of mass and moment of inertia about the X, Y, Z axes.
- Format for storing bond topology, which permits different bond orders and fractional bonds in graphene. The bond order may change between frames. To be efficient, only store the bonds that have changed.
- Record which amount of hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR) was used. For now, assume 1.0 amu.

Quantum chemistry:
- Add an alternative serialization scheme for storing electron probabilities from ab initio molecular simulations.
  - Store the densities for each "important" electron at the mechanosynthesis site.
  - The remaining valence electrons are grouped into a collective density distribution.
  - Core electrons are stored in another collective density distribution.

[^1]: If this become a bottleneck, try scripting in Swift, a language you must get slightly acquainted with to use Molecular Renderer. <b>Always compile in release mode; debug mode is as slow as Python.</b> [PythonKit](https://github.com/pvieito/PythonKit) should allow most of your scripting code to remain written in Python; only the top-level program must be invoked from the Swift compiler.
