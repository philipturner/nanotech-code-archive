# Reconstruction

This is a mini-library for reconstructing diamond (100) surfaces.

## API Format

This code is currently being stored in the hardware catalog. It may eventually become a standalone Swift module, depending on how it's used. If so, the most sensible place is the HDL repository.

The final form of the API is unknown; it is currently an experiment.
