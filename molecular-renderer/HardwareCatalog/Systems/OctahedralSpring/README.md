# Octahedral Spring

Author: Philip Turner

> NOTE: This nano-part has not been designed.

Description: originated from the constraint of building springs with only (110) and (111) surfaces of cubic diamond, and no sharp corners (5-membered rings). The top and bottom of the spring do not include a shaped interface to other parts. You must design an interface and covalently weld using CSG. The images show one possible interface created in external code.

Parameters:
- Width (Int)

Improvements: a variant could use only one of 4 legs, for reduced atom count. However, that design may be more susceptible to sideways sagging.
